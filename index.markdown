<p>I am currently a research scientist at Huawei OS kernel lab. I received my Ph.D. degree (advised by Prof. Binyu Zang and Haibo Chen) in Computer Science from the Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (<a href="https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/">IPADS</a>), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2023.
My major research interests include microkernels, energy-aware scheduling, scalable synchronization, and weak memory models.
